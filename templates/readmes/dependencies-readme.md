#The Dependencies Folder

This folder allows you to add plugin, theme, and dropin dependencies to your project. Set up a dependecy repository that contains `plugins`, `themes`, and `dropins` folders in it and put any dependencies into them. During setup, these dependencies will be symlinked into the appropraite place within the WordPress install.
