# Command Reference

## Yoman commands

### vvv
```
$ yo vvv
```

Lists available generators

### vvv:json
```
$ yo vvv:json
```
This command creates a `vvv.json` file that can then be shared with other developers. This JSON file defines the entire WordPress site, including domain names, plugins, and themes.

See "Creating a Shareable Project" above for workflow tips.

### vvv:bootstrap
```
$ yo vvv:bootstrap
```

This command takes a `vvv.json` file and (depending) a database .sql file and creates the entire project. See "Receiving a shared project" for workflow tips.

### vvv:create
```
$ yo vvv:create
```
This command combines `vvv:json` and `vvv:bootstrap` into one command to make it easy to create a completely new site.

## Grunt Commands
Available once yoman has completed to manage the installation's relationship with Vagrant. Provides access to handy shell files and vagrant commands from a grunt command line that is running on the host machine.

### Grunt (default)
````
$ grunt
````
Runs `git pull` on your theme, plugin, and dependencies repositories. It then runs `vagrant up`, which will have no effect if vagrant is already running, and then `vagrant provision` (see below)

### provision
````
$ grunt provision
````
Runs `vagrant provision`

### db
````
$ grunt db
````
This command imports any .sql or .sql.gz file it finds in `/config/data/'.
If vvv.json specifies an original/production URL, it will also run an update db script that runs the wp-cli command `wp search-replace`.

This can be a handy command if you want to switch between databases. For example you have a database that mirrors production and you also have a database with theme unit tests. You can have both sql files in `/config/data/` â€” to switch, remove the .imported extension and run this command.

### plugins
````
$ grunt plugins
````
Runs a script that updates the current installation with any plugins specified in the `/config/org-plugins` file. This file is created by vvv.json.

To add a wordpress.org plugin to an already active installation:
* add the plugin slug to the vvv.json file (so that others you share this project get the benefit).
* add the plugin slug to `/config/org-plugins`
* run this command

### themes
````
$ grunt themes
````
Runs a script that updates the current installation with any plugins specified in the `/config/org-themes` file. This file is created by vvv.json.

### relink
````
$ grunt relink
````
Runs `git pull` on the dependencies repository to pull down any changes, then runs a command to re-establish all the symlinks.

This is highly useful if you add or remove anything from the dependencies repository. Commit and push your changes to the dependencies repository, then run `grunt relink` to bring them into your project.

### proxy_on
````
$ grunt proxy_on
````
Turns the image proxy on (it is on by default). When the image proxy is on and vvv.json specifies an original URL, Nginx will look to the original URL for static assets if they are not found locally. This makes it so we don't need all of wp-content/uploads locally.

### proxy_off
````
$ grunt proxy_off
````
Turns the image proxy off. This may be helpful for debugging.

### cleanup
````
$ grunt cleanup
````
This removes _everything_ that generator-vvv created _except_ vvv.json and any local databases.

If you'd like to re-create the install from scratch, you can immediately run `yo vvv:bootstrap`.
